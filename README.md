# Parking Assistant

This project uses a Flask API and React-Native App that uses serial communication to update parking spot availability. It also uses the Cohere API to generate text based on a prompt.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment.
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate
        ```
5. Install the requirements.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the App

1. Activate the virtual environment if it's not activated.
2. Connect to and setup your arduino to desired port
3. Run the Flask app.
    ```bash
    flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
    ```
4. Launch react app

Note: Running the server with `--host=0.0.0.0` will make it accessible from any IP address. This is useful for testing but not recommended for production due to security concerns.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Returns the number of free parking spots.
- `POST /ask_question`: Takes a string `input_string` in JSON format and returns a text generated by Cohere API.
